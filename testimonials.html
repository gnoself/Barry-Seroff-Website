                        <p>"On my wedding day, I was surprised with a beautiful composition for my processional, composed just for me by Barry Seroff. He and my husband came together to create an elegant and memorable masterpiece that was talked about throughout the rest of the day. I could not be more touched and grateful. Not only did Barry entertain my guests with melodies that ranged from guitar to flute, he gave us this one of a kind gift of song. Thank you Barry."</p>

                        <p>"I hired Barry to perform during my sister’s baby shower. She wanted something very tasteful. I wanted something that did not require a lot of me, since I was so busy with arranging the rest of the party. We were both so pleased with Barry. He was prompt, professional, fun and the perfect touch to a beautiful day. I will definitely hire him for our next occasion."</p>

                        <p>"What can I say about Barry Seroff?  We had a power outage the night of my birthday party, when we hired Barry. We didn’t know what to expect. We lit candles and fireplaces and tried to make the best of it. Then entered Barry. He turned what could have been a disaster into the best party we’ve ever thrown. He was very mailable and accommodating and really lifted the spirits of the entire place. He was fantastic with my nieces and nephews as well, who were instantly drawn to him. The night wouldn’t have been the same without Barry!"</p>

                        <p>"Barry performed at my wedding and my wife and I could not have been more thrilled. He performed in two capacities, playing guitar for the ceremony and flute during the reception. He was prompt, professional, and provided a dimension of expression that I know everyone enjoyed. My wife and I are both musicians, so we can be very picky. But Barry exceeded our expectations in every way!"</p>
